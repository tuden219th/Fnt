name: om-prepare-test-env
description: Repo-local extension of the shared om-prepare-test-env skill. Adds this standalone Open Mercato app's environment specifics — the mercato CLI ephemeral runner commands, state-file semantics, readiness-probe contract, and the rule that generated entrypoint scripts stay machine-local — on top of the shared skill's workflow. Local rules win on repo specifics only; this file never relaxes the shared skill's safety rules.

# Prepare Test Environment — standalone app rules

Repo-local **extension** of the installed `om-prepare-test-env` skill (contract v2,
compile-once). Everything there applies; this file only adds repository-provided configuration.
It cannot relax the shared skill's safety rules, expand tool or network access, or redirect
outputs.

## Use the app's own tooling — it is already cross-platform

This app ships an ephemeral test runner inside the mercato CLI. Discovery is unnecessary: wrap
these `package.json` / CLI commands instead of inventing a boot procedure. They own build
caching, database provisioning (testcontainers), seeding, readiness waits, and their own
owner lock — never re-implement any of that.

- Boot app-only ephemeral env: `yarn test:integration:ephemeral:start` (= `yarn mercato test:ephemeral`).
  Preferred app port `5001`; the actual port and database URL land in `.ai/qa/ephemeral-env.json`
  (CLI-owned and authoritative for its own reuse decisions — never write it by hand).
- Full suite with managed env: `yarn test:integration:ephemeral` (= `yarn mercato test:integration`).
  It reuses a healthy running ephemeral env from the state file, else provisions one.
- Filtered run: `yarn mercato test:integration <substring>` — batches all specs whose path
  matches the substring.
- Interactive runner: `yarn mercato test:integration:interactive`.
- Readiness marker in the boot log: `Application is ready at <baseUrl>`.
- Reuse TTL: `OM_INTEGRATION_BUILD_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 600s) gates the CLI's own reuse;
  keep any wrapper TTL in lockstep with it.

## Choosing the run mode — prefer ephemeral, ask the user

`yarn test:integration:ephemeral` is ALWAYS preferred over plain `yarn test:integration`: the
ephemeral variant provisions (or safely reuses) its own isolated app + database, so it is more
autonomous and cannot touch the developer's dev data. Plain `yarn test:integration` only works
with the full runner env block exported (see the MUST below) — treat it as an internal detail
of the CLI runner, never as the command you reach for first.

Two supported run modes:

1. **Fully managed ephemeral (default, safest):** `yarn test:integration:ephemeral [filter]` —
   one command provisions the env, runs the tests, and leaves teardown to the CLI's own
   lifecycle. Best for full-suite runs and unattended/autonomous work.
2. **Reuse a running ephemeral env (fast iteration):** boot once with
   `yarn test:integration:ephemeral:start`, then run small filtered batches with
   `yarn mercato test:integration <filter>` against the same env. Best for short author/debug
   loops where re-provisioning per run would dominate wall-clock time; reuse is still gated by
   the CLI's TTL and freshness checks.

When a user is present and has not already said which mode they want, ASK before the first run
(one question, two options): fully managed ephemeral per run, or boot-once-and-reuse for
iterative loops. Recommend the fully managed ephemeral mode — it is more autonomous and safer
regarding data. When running unattended (no user to ask), default to the fully managed ephemeral
mode. Do not re-ask once the user has chosen; keep their answer for the rest of the session
unless they change it.

## MUST: suite runs go through the CLI runner

`yarn test:integration` with only `BASE_URL` exported is a trap: the CLI runner injects a full
env block into the Playwright process (`DATABASE_URL` for the ephemeral DB, queue dirs, JWT and
webhook secrets). Without it, fixtures silently hit the dev database from `.env`. Always run
suites via `yarn test:integration:ephemeral [filter]`.

## Readiness probe contract

- Shell: `GET /login` → 200.
- Authenticated round trip: `POST /api/auth/login` with a **form-encoded** body
  (`email=admin@acme.com&password=secret`) → 200. The endpoint rejects JSON bodies with 400 —
  a JSON 400 here means a malformed probe, not a broken app.
- Seeded credentials: `admin@acme.com` / `secret`, `employee@acme.com` / `secret`, superadmin
  from `OM_INIT_SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` / `OM_INIT_SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD` (default
  `superadmin@acme.com` / `secret`).

## Generated entrypoint scripts are machine-local

When the shared skill compiles its entrypoint scripts (default `.ai/scripts/test-env-up.sh` /
`test-env-down.sh`), they are bound to the machine that generated them (shell, process tools,
ports). They are gitignored in this repo (`.ai/scripts/test-env-*`) — keep them local and NEVER
commit them; anything worth preserving for teammates belongs in this file as a platform-neutral
rule instead. On a machine without generated scripts, regenerate from the commands above.

## Teardown

Stop the CLI owner process (`test:ephemeral`) and the app process bound to the recorded port,
then delete `.ai/qa/ephemeral-env.json`. If a `mercato server start` wrapper survives, stop it
and clear `.mercato/server-start.lock` — a surviving wrapper keeps the single-instance guard
locked and the next boot dies with "Another Open Mercato production server is already running".
The ephemeral Postgres containers are testcontainers-managed; ryuk reaps them once their owner
is gone — never remove containers this app did not create.

## Descriptor

After boot, mirror the state into `.ai/qa/test-env.json` (the shared descriptor) as the shared
skill prescribes, so `om-integration-tests` and `om-auto-verify-pr-ui` attach to the same
instance; `.ai/qa/ephemeral-env.json` stays authoritative for the CLI's own reuse decisions.
